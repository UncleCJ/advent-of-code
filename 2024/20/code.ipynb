       "<h2>--- Day 20: Race Condition ---</h2><p>The Historians are quite pixelated again. This time, a massive, black building looms over you - you're <a href=\"/2017/day/24\">right outside</a> the CPU!</p>\n",
       "<p>While The Historians get to work, a nearby program sees that you're idle and challenges you to a <em>race</em>. Apparently, you've arrived just in time for the frequently-held <em>race condition</em> festival!</p>\n",
       "<p>The race takes place on a particularly long and twisting code path; programs compete to see who can finish in the <em>fewest picoseconds</em>. The <span title=\"If we give away enough mutexes, maybe someone will use one of them to fix the race condition!\">winner</span> even gets their very own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\" target=\"_blank\">mutex</a>!</p>\n",
       "<p>They hand you a <em>map of the racetrack</em> (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n",
       "<pre><code>###############\n",

       "<p>The map consists of track (<code>.</code>) - including the <em>start</em> (<code>S</code>) and <em>end</em> (<code>E</code>) positions (both of which also count as track) - and <em>walls</em> (<code>#</code>).</p>\n",
       "<p>When a program runs through the racetrack, it starts at the start position. Then, it is allowed to move up, down, left, or right; each such move takes <em>1 picosecond</em>. The goal is to reach the end position as quickly as possible. In this example racetrack, the fastest time is <code>84</code> picoseconds.</p>\n",
       "<p>Because there is only a single path from the start to the end and the programs all go the same speed, the races used to be pretty boring. To make things more interesting, they introduced a new rule to the races: programs are allowed to <em>cheat</em>.</p>\n",
       "<p>The rules for cheating are very strict. <em>Exactly once</em> during a race, a program may <em>disable collision</em> for up to <em>2 picoseconds</em>. This allows the program to <em>pass through walls</em> as if they were regular track. At the end of the cheat, the program must be back on normal track again; otherwise, it will receive a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault\" target=\"_blank\">segmentation fault</a> and get disqualified.</p>\n",
