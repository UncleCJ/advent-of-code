       "<p>Maybe there's something you can do to break up the hailstones?</p>\n",
       "<p>Due to strong, probably-magical winds, the hailstones are all flying through the air in perfectly linear trajectories. You make a note of each hailstone's <em>position</em> and <em>velocity</em> (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n",

       "20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3\n",
       "</code></pre>\n",
       "<p>Each line of text corresponds to the position and velocity of a single hailstone. The positions indicate where the hailstones are <em>right now</em> (at time <code>0</code>). The velocities are constant and indicate exactly how far each hailstone will move in <em>one nanosecond</em>.</p>\n",
       "<p>Each line of text uses the format <code>px py pz @ vx vy vz</code>. For instance, the hailstone specified by <code>20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3</code> has initial X position <code>20</code>, Y position <code>19</code>, Z position <code>15</code>, X velocity <code>1</code>, Y velocity <code>-5</code>, and Z velocity <code>-3</code>.
