       "<h2>--- Day 25: Let It Snow ---</h2><p>Merry Christmas!  Santa is booting up his weather machine; looks like you might get a <a href=\"1\">white Christmas</a> after all.</p>\n",
       "<p>The weather machine beeps!  On the console of the machine is a copy protection message asking you to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection#Early_video_games\">enter a code from the instruction manual</a>.  Apparently, it refuses to run unless you give it that code.  No problem; you'll just look up the code in the--</p>\n",
       "<p>\"Ho ho ho\", Santa ponders aloud.  \"I can't seem to find the manual.\"</p>\n",
       "<p>You look up the support number for the manufacturer and give them a call.  Good thing, too - that 49th star wasn't going to earn itself.</p>\n",
       "<p>\"Oh, that machine is quite old!\", they tell you.  \"That model went out of support six minutes ago, and we just finished shredding all of the manuals.  I bet we can find you the code generation algorithm, though.\"</p>\n",
       "<p>After putting you on hold for twenty minutes (your call is <em>very</em> important to them, it reminded you repeatedly), they finally find an engineer that remembers how the code system works.</p>\n",
       "<p>The codes are printed on an <span title=\"The paper is very thin so it can be folded up neatly into the manual.\">infinite sheet of paper</span>, starting in the top-left corner.  The codes are filled in by diagonals: starting with the first row with an empty first box, the codes are filled in diagonally up and to the right.  This process repeats until the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor's_diagonal_argument\">infinite paper is covered</a>.  So, the first few codes are filled in in this order:</p>\n",

       "<p>For example, the 12th code would be written to row <code>4</code>, column <code>2</code>; the 15th code would be written to row <code>1</code>, column <code>5</code>.</p>\n",
       "<p>The voice on the other end of the phone continues with how the codes are actually generated.  The first code is <code>20151125</code>.  After that, each code is generated by taking the previous one, multiplying it by <code>252533</code>, and then keeping the remainder from dividing that value by <code>33554393</code>.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, to find the second code (which ends up in row <code>2</code>, column <code>1</code>), start with the previous value, <code>20151125</code>.  Multiply it by <code>252533</code> to get <code>5088824049625</code>.  Then, divide that by <code>33554393</code>, which leaves a remainder of <code>31916031</code>.  That remainder is the second code.</p>\n",
