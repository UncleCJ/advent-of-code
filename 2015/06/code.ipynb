The instructions include whether to <code>turn on</code>, <code>turn off</code>, or <code>toggle</code> various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs.  Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like <code>0,0 through 2,2</code> therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square.
