It's an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game\">RPG</a>, and he's stuck on a boss.  He needs to know what equipment to buy at the shop.  He hands you the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller\">controller</a>.</p>\n",
       "<p>In this game, the player (you) and the enemy (the boss) take turns attacking.  The player always goes first.  Each attack reduces the opponent's hit points by at least <code>1</code>.  The first character at or below <code>0</code> hit points loses.</p>\n",
       "<p>Damage dealt by an attacker each turn is equal to the attacker's damage score minus the defender's armor score.  An attacker always does at least <code>1</code> damage.  So, if the attacker has a damage score of <code>8</code>, and the defender has an armor score of <code>3</code>, the defender loses <code>5</code> hit points.  If the defender had an armor score of <code>300</code>, the defender would still lose <code>1</code> hit point.</p>\n",
