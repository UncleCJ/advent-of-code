The computer system that runs this port isn't compatible with the docking program on the ferry, so the docking parameters aren't being correctly initialized in the docking program's memory.</p>\n","<p>After a brief inspection, you discover that the sea port's computer system uses a strange <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)\" target=\"_blank\">bitmask</a> system in its initialization program. Although you don't have the correct decoder chip handy, you can emulate it in software!</p>\n","<p>The initialization program (your puzzle input) can either update the bitmask or write a value to memory.  Values and memory addresses are both 36-bit unsigned integers.  For example, ignoring bitmasks for a moment, a line like <code>mem[8] = 11</code> would write the value <code>11</code> to memory address <code>8</code>.</p>\n","<p>The bitmask is always given as a string of 36 bits, written with the most significant bit (representing <code>2^35</code>) on the left and the least significant bit (<code>2^0</code>, that is, the <code>1</code>s bit) on the right. The current bitmask is applied to values immediately before they are written to memory: a <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> overwrites the corresponding bit in the value, while an <code>X</code> leaves the bit in the value unchanged.</p>\n","<p>For example, consider the following program:</p>\n","<pre><code>mask = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\n","mem[8] = 11\n","mem[7] = 101\n","mem[8] = 0\n","</code></pre>\n","<p>This program starts by specifying a bitmask (<code>mask = ....</code>). The mask it specifies will overwrite two bits in every written value: the <code>2</code>s bit is overwritten with <code>0</code>, and the <code>64</code>s bit is overwritten with <code>1</code>.</p>\n","<p>The program then attempts to write the value <code>11</code> to memory address <code>8</code>. By expanding everything out to individual bits, the mask is applied as follows:</p>\n","<pre><code>value:  000000000000000000000000000000001011  (decimal 11)\n","mask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\n","result: 00000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>0010<em>0</em>1  (decimal 73)\n","</code></pre>\n","<p>So, because of the mask, the value <code>73</code> is written to memory address <code>8</code> instead. Then, the program tries to write <code>101</code> to address <code>7</code>:</p>\n","<pre><code>value:  000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\n","mask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\n","result: 00000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>1001<em>0</em>1  (decimal 101)\n","</code></pre>\n","<p>This time, the mask has no effect, as the bits it overwrote were already the values the mask tried to set. Finally, the program tries to write <code>0</code> to address <code>8</code>:</p>\n","<pre><code>value:  000000000000000000000000000000000000  (decimal 0)\n","mask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\n","result: 00000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>0000<em>0</em>0  (decimal 64)\n","</code></pre>\n","<p><code>64</code> is written to address <code>8</code> instead, overwriting the value that was there previously.</p>\n","<p>To initialize your ferry's docking program, you need the sum of all values left in memory after the initialization program completes. (The entire 36-bit address space begins initialized to the value <code>0</code> at every address.) In the above example, only two values in memory are not zero - <code>101</code> (at address <code>7</code>) and <code>64</code> (at address <code>8</code>) - producing a sum of <em><code>165</code></em>.</p>\n","<p>Execute the initialization program. <em>What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes?</em> (Do not truncate the sum to 36 bits.)</p>\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["HTML(downloaded['part1'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Boilerplate\n","\n","Let's try using [pycodestyle_magic](https://github.com/mattijn/pycodestyle_magic) with pycodestyle (flake8 stopped working for me in VS Code Jupyter).
