While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and therefore aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world.\n","\n","It seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary.\n","\n","Due to some questionable network security, you realize you might be able to solve both of these problems at the same time."]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 1\n","\n","The automatic passport scanners are slow because they're having trouble *detecting which passports have all required fields*. The expected fields are as follows:\n","\n","- `byr` (Birth Year)\n","- `iyr` (Issue Year)\n","- `eyr` (Expiration Year)\n","- `hgt` (Height)\n","- `hcl` (Hair Color)\n","- `ecl` (Eye Color)\n","- `pid` (Passport ID)\n","- `cid` (Country ID)\n","\n","Passport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input).
