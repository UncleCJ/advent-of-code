While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and therefore aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world.</p>\n","<p>It seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary.</p>\n","<p>Due to some questionable network security, you realize you might be able to solve both of these problems at the same time.</p>\n","<p>The automatic passport scanners are slow because they're having trouble <em>detecting which passports have all required fields</em>. The expected fields are as follows:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li><code>byr</code> (Birth Year)</li>\n","<li><code>iyr</code> (Issue Year)</li>\n","<li><code>eyr</code> (Expiration Year)</li>\n","<li><code>hgt</code> (Height)</li>\n","<li><code>hcl</code> (Hair Color)</li>\n","<li><code>ecl</code> (Eye Color)</li>\n","<li><code>pid</code> (Passport ID)</li>\n","<li><code>cid</code> (Country ID)</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>Passport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input).

The second passport is <em>invalid</em> - it is missing <code>hgt</code> (the Height field).</p>\n","<p>The third passport is interesting; the <em>only missing field</em> is <code>cid</code>, so it looks like data from North Pole Credentials, not a passport at all! Surely, nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing <code>cid</code> fields.  Treat this \"passport\" as <em>valid</em>.</p>\n","<p>The fourth passport is missing two fields, <code>cid</code> and <code>byr</code>. Missing <code>cid</code> is fine, but missing any other field is not, so this passport is <em>invalid</em>.</p>\n","<p>According to the above rules, your improved system would report <code><em>2</em></code> valid passports.</p>\n","<p>Count the number of <em>valid</em> passports - those that have all required fields.
