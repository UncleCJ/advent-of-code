While you consider checking the in-flight menu for one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella, you are interrupted by the kid sitting next to you.</p>\n","<p>Their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console\">handheld game console</a> won't turn on! They ask if you can take a look.</p>\n","<p>You narrow the problem down to a strange <em>infinite loop</em> in the <span title=\"A trendy new line of encrypted footwear?\">boot code</span> (your puzzle input) of the device. You should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.</p>\n","<p>The boot code is represented as a text file with one <em>instruction</em> per line of text. Each instruction consists of an <em>operation</em> (<code>acc</code>, <code>jmp</code>, or <code>nop</code>) and an <em>argument</em> (a signed number like <code>+4</code> or <code>-20</code>).</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li><code>acc</code> increases or decreases a single global value called the <em>accumulator</em> by the value given in the argument. For example, <code>acc +7</code> would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at <code>0</code>. After an <code>acc</code> instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.</li>\n","<li><code>jmp</code> <em>jumps</em> to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an <em>offset</em> from the <code>jmp</code> instruction; for example, <code>jmp +2</code> would skip the next instruction, <code>jmp +1</code> would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and <code>jmp -20</code> would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.</li>\n","<li><code>nop</code> stands for <em>No OPeration</em> - it does nothing.  The instruction immediately below it is executed next.</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>For example, consider the following program:</p>\n","<pre><code>nop +0\n","acc +1\n","jmp +4\n","acc +3\n","jmp -3\n","acc -99\n","acc +1\n","jmp -4\n","acc +6\n","</code></pre>\n","<p>These instructions are visited in this order:</p>\n","<pre><code>nop +0  | 1\n","acc +1  | 2, 8(!)\n","jmp +4  | 3\n","acc +3  | 6\n","jmp -3  | 7\n","acc -99 |\n","acc +1  | 4\n","jmp -4  | 5\n","acc +6  |\n","</code></pre>\n","<p>First, the <code>nop +0</code> does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (<code>acc +1</code>) and <code>jmp +4</code> sets the next instruction to the other <code>acc +1</code> near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, <code>jmp -4</code> executes, setting the next instruction to the only <code>acc +3</code>. It sets the accumulator to 5, and <code>jmp -3</code> causes the program to continue back at the first <code>acc +1</code>.</p>\n","<p>This is an <em>infinite loop</em>: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.</p>\n","<p>Immediately <em>before</em> the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is <em><code>5</code></em>.</p>\n","<p>Run your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, <em>what value is in the accumulator?</em></p>\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["HTML(downloaded['part1'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Boilerplate\n","\n","Let's try using [pycodestyle_magic](https://github.com/mattijn/pycodestyle_magic) with pycodestyle (flake8 stopped working for me in VS Code Jupyter).
