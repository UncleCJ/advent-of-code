    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above example, *`2`* passwords are valid. The middle password, `cdefg`, is not; it contains no instances of b, but needs at least `1`. The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one `a` or nine `c`, both within the limits of their respective policies.\n",
