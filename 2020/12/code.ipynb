       "<p>Unfortunately, the ship's navigation computer seems to be malfunctioning; rather than giving a route directly to safety, it produced extremely circuitous instructions. When the captain uses the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system\" target=\"_blank\">PA system</a> to ask if anyone can help, you quickly volunteer.</p>\n",
       "<p>The navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character <em>actions</em> paired with integer input <em>values</em>. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out what they probably mean:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Action <em><code>N</code></em> means to move <em>north</em> by the given value.</li>\n",
       "<li>Action <em><code>S</code></em> means to move <em>south</em> by the given value.</li>\n",
       "<li>Action <em><code>E</code></em> means to move <em>east</em> by the given value.</li>\n",
       "<li>Action <em><code>W</code></em> means to move <em>west</em> by the given value.</li>\n",
       "<li>Action <em><code>L</code></em> means to turn <em>left</em> the given number of degrees.</li>\n",
       "<li>Action <em><code>R</code></em> means to turn <em>right</em> the given number of degrees.</li>\n",

       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>The ship starts by facing <em>east</em>. Only the <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> actions change the direction the ship is facing. (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is <code>N10</code>, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were <code>F</code>.)</p>\n",

       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><code>F10</code> would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to <em>east 10, north 0</em>.</li>\n",
       "<li><code>N3</code> would move the ship 3 units north to <em>east 10, north 3</em>.</li>\n",
       "<li><code>F7</code> would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to <em>east 17, north 3</em>.</li>\n",
       "<li><code>R90</code> would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face <em>south</em>; it remains at <em>east 17, north 3</em>.</li>\n",
