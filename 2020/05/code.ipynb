You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.</p>\n","<p>You write a <span title=\"No problem!\">quick program</span> to use your phone's camera to scan all of the nearby boarding passes (your puzzle input); perhaps you can find your seat through process of elimination.</p>\n","<p>Instead of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHbLRjF0vo\">zones or groups</a>, this airline uses <em>binary space partitioning</em> to seat people. A seat might be specified like <code>FBFBBFFRLR</code>, where <code>F</code> means \"front\", <code>B</code> means \"back\", <code>L</code> means \"left\", and <code>R</code> means \"right\".</p>\n","<p>The first 7 characters will either be <code>F</code> or <code>B</code>; these specify exactly one of the <em>128 rows</em> on the plane (numbered <code>0</code> through <code>127</code>). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the <em>front</em> (<code>0</code> through <code>63</code>) or the <em>back</em> (<code>64</code> through <code>127</code>). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.</p>\n","<p>For example, consider just the first seven characters of <code>FBFBBFFRLR</code>:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li>Start by considering the whole range, rows <code>0</code> through <code>127</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>F</code> means to take the <em>lower half</em>, keeping rows <code>0</code> through <code>63</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>B</code> means to take the <em>upper half</em>, keeping rows <code>32</code> through <code>63</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>F</code> means to take the <em>lower half</em>, keeping rows <code>32</code> through <code>47</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>B</code> means to take the <em>upper half</em>, keeping rows <code>40</code> through <code>47</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>B</code> keeps rows <code>44</code> through <code>47</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>F</code> keeps rows <code>44</code> through <code>45</code>.</li>\n","<li>The final <code>F</code> keeps the lower of the two, <em>row <code>44</code></em>.</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>The last three characters will be either <code>L</code> or <code>R</code>; these specify exactly one of the <em>8 columns</em> of seats on the plane (numbered <code>0</code> through <code>7</code>). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps.  <code>L</code> means to keep the <em>lower half</em>, while <code>R</code> means to keep the <em>upper half</em>.</p>\n","<p>For example, consider just the last 3 characters of <code>FBFBBFFRLR</code>:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li>Start by considering the whole range, columns <code>0</code> through <code>7</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>R</code> means to take the <em>upper half</em>, keeping columns <code>4</code> through <code>7</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>L</code> means to take the <em>lower half</em>, keeping columns <code>4</code> through <code>5</code>.</li>\n","<li>The final <code>R</code> keeps the upper of the two, <em>column <code>5</code></em>.</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>So, decoding <code>FBFBBFFRLR</code> reveals that it is the seat at <em>row <code>44</code>, column <code>5</code></em>.</p>\n","<p>Every seat also has a unique <em>seat ID</em>: multiply the row by 8, then add the column. In this example, the seat has ID <code>44 * 8 + 5 = <em>357</em></code>.</p>\n","<p>Here are some other boarding passes:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li><code>BFFFBBFRRR</code>: row <code>70</code>, column <code>7</code>, seat ID <code>567</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>FFFBBBFRRR</code>: row <code>14</code>, column <code>7</code>, seat ID <code>119</code>.</li>\n","<li><code>BBFFBBFRLL</code>: row <code>102</code>, column <code>4</code>, seat ID <code>820</code>.</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>As a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes. <em>What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass?</em></p>\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["HTML(downloaded['part1'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Boilerplate\n","\n","Let's try using [pycodestyle_magic](https://github.com/mattijn/pycodestyle_magic) with pycodestyle (flake8 stopped working for me in VS Code Jupyter)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%load_ext pycodestyle_magic"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%pycodestyle_on"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Comments\n","\n","..."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["testdata = \"\"\"FBFBBFFRLR\n","BFFFBBFRRR\n","FFFBBBFRRR\n","BBFFBBFRLL\"\"\".splitlines()\n","\n","# inputdata = downloaded['input'].splitlines()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from collections.abc import Iterable\n","\n","\n","def my_part1_solution(data: Iterable[str]) -> int:\n","    return 0"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# assert(my_part1_solution(testdata) == 820)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# my_part1_solution(inputdata)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Part Two"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# HTML(downloaded['part2'])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def my_part2_solution(data: Iterable[str]) -> int:\n","    return 0"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# assert(my_part2_solution(testdata) == ...)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# my_part2_solution(inputdata)"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.6.9 64-bit","metadata":{"interpreter":{"hash":"31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6"}},"name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
