Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!\n","\n","For example, consider the following rules:\n","\n","```\n","light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.\n","dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.\n","bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.\n","muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.\n","shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.\n","dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.\n","vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.\n","faded blue bags contain no other bags.\n","dotted black bags contain no other bags.\n","```\n","\n","These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every `faded blue` bag is empty, every `vibrant plum` bag contains 11 bags (5 `faded blue` and 6 `dotted black`), and so on.\n","\n","You have a *`shiny gold`* bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one `shiny gold` bag?)\n","\n","In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:\n","\n","- A `bright white` bag, which can hold your `shiny gold` bag directly.\n","- A `muted yellow` bag, which can hold your `shiny gold` bag directly, plus some other bags.\n","- A `dark orange` bag, which can hold `bright white` and `muted yellow` bags, either of which could then hold your `shiny gold` bag.\n","- A `light red` bag, which can hold `bright white` and `muted yellow` bags, either of which could then hold your `shiny gold` bag.\n","\n","So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one `shiny gold` bag is *`4`*.\n","\n","*How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one `shiny gold` bag?* (The list of rules is quite long; make sure you get all of it.)\n","\n","To begin, [get your puzzle input](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7/input)."]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["with open('input.txt', 'r') as inp:\n","    inputdata = [line.strip() for line in inp.readlines()]"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["answer = 0\n","\n","# write your solution here - 'inputdata' is a list of the lines"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 2\n","\n","..."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["answer = 0\n","\n","# write your solution here - 'inputdata' is a list of the lines"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3.6.9 64-bit","metadata":{"interpreter":{"hash":"31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6"}}},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.9-final","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
