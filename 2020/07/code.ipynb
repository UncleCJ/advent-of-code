Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!</p>\n","<p>For example, consider the following rules:</p>\n","<pre><code>light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.\n","dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.\n","bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.\n","muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.\n","shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.\n","dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.\n","vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.\n","faded blue bags contain no other bags.\n","dotted black bags contain no other bags.\n","</code></pre>\n","<p>These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types.
